# Midterm-2-Algebra-problem-maker/solver
Make a Algebra problem solver that generates a one or two-variable equation and gives steps to solve for it
## Overview
This project integrates:
- **Tkinter for GUI**
- **Sympy for algerbraically solving the equation and giving steps**
- **Random for the algerbra generation**
